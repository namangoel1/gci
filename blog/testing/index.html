    <h1>Mocking, Spying, and Stubbing</h1>

    <p>In test-driven development (TDD), mocking, spying, and stubbing are three important methods. Mocking allows checking functions without dependencies, increasing speed and reducing chances of error; spying allows to check the 'indirect output' of code; stubbing allows to simulate functions to reduce their complexity and increase speed for testing.</p>

    <p>In the post, I'll be talking about testing through <a href="http://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> and <a href="http://sinonjs.org/">Sinon.JS</a>, both based on Node JS.</p>

    <h2>The mailer</h2>

    <p>In this post we'll be discussing on running tests on a mailer function. This takes two arguments, <code>req</code> (request), and <code>res</code> (response). The function looks like this: </p>

    <pre><code>function rootPost(req, res) {
      var email =  {
        from: 'Fossasia &lt;fossasia@fossasia.com&gt;',
        to: req.body.to,
        subject: req.body.subject, 
        text: req.body.message,
      };


      mailer.send(email, function(error, info){

        if ( error ) {
            req.flash('info', error);
        } else {
            req.flash('info', 'Email sent sucessfully!');
        }


        res.render('index', { flash: req.flash('info') });
      });
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p><code>req.body</code> contains all information of the email (subject, message, etc). </p>

    <p>The inner <code>mailer</code> function is what actually sends the email. It calls many dependencies, and we'll have to mock it for efficient testing. </p>

    <p><code>req.flash()</code> gives useful information on if the mailer is sent or not. We'll need to spy on this method.</p>

    <p>The function can be considered finished when it finally runs <code>res.render(...)</code>. We'll need to mock <code>res.render()</code> to check for that.</p>

    <h2>Supplying arguments</h2>

    <p>The basic structure of our test will be as follows:</p>

    <pre><code>var testRequest = {};

    testRequest.body =  {
      to: 'mail@namanyayg.com',
      subject: 'Test', 
      message: 'Test',
    };

    ...    

    testResponse = {
      render: function() {
        ...
      }
    }; 

    routes.rootPost(testRequest, testResponse); 
    // This is the rootPost function as above
    </code></pre>

    <p>We'll be supplying <code>testRequest</code> and <code>testResponse</code> to the rootPost function. <code>testRequest.body</code> be an object with the email's info. </p>

    <h2>Spying</h2>

    <p>Sinon.JS provides a <code>.spy()</code> method to create a test spy that records some basic information about the function it is spying on, how many times it's called, what arguments it was supplied with, etc. The <code>.spy()</code> method does not modify the function in question.</p>

    <p>We'll be spying on an existing method, namely, the <code>req.flash()</code> method. At the end of the test, we'll need to check if the arguments passed to <code>req.flash()</code> contain 'Email Sent Successfully!' or not. If not, the the function has failed and there's some problem in the test.</p>

    <p>Create a spy is simple - You simply use the <code>sinon.spy()</code> method. Since we need to spy on <code>req.flash()</code>, we'll do this:</p>

    <pre><code>testRequest.flash = sinon.spy();
    </code></pre>

    <p>With this one-liner, we'll be able to check if the arguments passed to <code>testRequst.flash()</code> have 'Email sent successfully!' or not.</p>
