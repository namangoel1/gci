  <h1>Decentralized Social Networks</h1>

  <p>Decentralized networks refer to a scheme of networking where no single organization or person has access to all data, instead, users can create their own servers and host applications for them and their groups.</p>

  <p>Decentralized social networking can be considered a 'democratic' way of social networking, where no organization is in complete control. Facebook, for example, has complete control and access to the data of all of it's users. It can decide who to allow, what to censor, and what information to expose. In contrast, <a href="https://diasporafoundation.org/">Diaspora*</a> and <a href="http://pump.io/">Pump.io</a>. Both are distributed social networks, and anyone can set up their own install and create their own network.</p>

  <p>Decentralized social networks are free-to-use, your data is not sold to advertisers, and you are free to create your own rules. Most have better privacy settings than centralized social networks, allowing extreme levels of fine-tuning over who sees your content.</p>

  <h2>Pros</h2>

  <ul>
  <li><p>Decentralized social networks allow high levels of privacy. You can use one anonymously and are not restricted by irrational constraints and rules imposed by a corporation.</p></li>
  <li><p>They protect your data. Facebook and like are <a href="http://consumerist.com/2014/06/12/facebook-is-now-selling-your-web-browsing-data-to-advertisers/">known to sell user data</a> to advertisers and governments. This is impossible with a centralized network.</p></li>
  <li><p>They allow complete control. You can choose who to share your content with. Diaspora* implements the concept of <a href="https://diasporafoundation.org/about#aspects">Aspects</a> with which you can selectively share content with specific groups.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why I will (probably) not use one</h2>

  <ul>
  <li><p>Set up is difficult. My own server uses Apache instead of Nginx, and there is little guidance for a setup on Apache. You can join pre-existing pods to use Diaspora* (such as <a href="https://diasp.org/">diasp.org</a> but then you have to put similar trust to the pod's administration as you trust a large corporation.</p></li>
  <li><p>It faces the chicken/egg problem. A new network needs users to generate content to make it popular, and no one will join a network that lacks users. This is similar to the chicken/egg problem where the chicken has to come from an egg, whereas the egg needs the nurturing of a chicken. Even Google+ was unable to beat this problem, it is almost impossible for upcoming decentralized networks to do so.</p></li>
  <li><p>While such networks are great for the technologically-minded, for a normal user, they are often tough to understand and use. Only a few of my friends will be comfortable using a new social network set up on my server.</p></li>
  <li><p>Importing existing data (photos, statuses, and most importantly <em>likes</em>) from social networks accounts (such as Facebook or Twitter) is a cubersome process, sometimes even impossible (you cannot import the <em>200 likes</em> you got on your photo on Facebook). Out of the handful that would be comfortable, less than half will bother to import.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The unfortunately problem with the adoption of such networks is that the average user does not care about their privacy and does not bother to register for something that's not Facebook/Twitter/Instagram.</p>
