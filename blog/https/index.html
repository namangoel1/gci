    <h1>The State of Encrypted Web Communication</h1>

    <h2>What is HTTPS?</h2>

    <p>HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure, a method of secure communication on the internet. It is formed by the layering of SSL/TLS over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol.</p>

    <p>The security of HTTPS comes from TLS. HTTPS security provides authentication between the website and the webserver. Any data sent from the user to the webserver is encrypted, and vice versa. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks, which exploit insecure communication between a website and it's host.</p>

    <h2>Why isn't HTTPS universal?</h2>

    <h3>Technical</h3>

    <p>Enabling HTTPS on your site requires you to install a <em>SSL Certificate</em> from a trusted certificate authority. Few such authorities exist and they can easily exploit the market. The certificate costs from $8 to $70, and installation is not a technically challenging procedure; difficult for novice users.</p>

    <h3>Politics</h3>

    <p>Surveillance programs find it to their advantage to install backdoors in sites and to avoid HTTPS. For example, <a href="http://www.verisign.com/static/001927.pdf">VeriSign gives user data if the law requires it</a>.</p>

    <h2>Making HTTPS Universal</h2>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Project</a> aim for a better, secure, private, and safe web.</p>

    <p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt CA</a> aims to offer free SSL certificates, beating the main hurdle when it comes to webmasters installing SSL.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/Https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> browser extension forces the browser to use the encrypted protocol wherever possible.</p>

    <p>Google recently made <a href="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.in/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal_6.html">HTTPS a ranking signal</a>. Sites that enable HTTPS are ranked higher in search results. This is to encourage developers and webmasters to move to HTTPS and to ensure user safety.</p>

    <p>One Time Password (OTP) drives like the <a href="https://www.crypto-stick.com/">Crypto Stick</a> allow stronger and randomized passwords. <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/story/13/12/02/130226/why-people-are-so-bad-at-picking-passwords">People are bad at passwords</a> and hardware devices like this allow another secure layer.</p>

    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-step_verification">2-step authentication</a> which needs access to the user's mobile device as well as their password make it difficult to comprimise accounts. <a href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/363">Dropbox</a> are some popular names that offer this.</p>
