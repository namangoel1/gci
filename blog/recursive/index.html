<h1>Recursive Acronyms</h1>
<p>Recursive acronym is an acronym (short form) that talks about itself in it's expanded expression. </p>

<p>It was first used in <em>Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</em>, where Hofstader uses the acronym GOD that stands for GOD Over Djinn to explain infinite series.</p>

<p>In computing, recursive acronyms are used primarly for humor; to refer to themselves or to other acronyms.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wine</strong> - Wine Is Not an Emulator. It is used to run Windows application on OSX and other Unix-like operating systems. Wine runs without virtualization and works by alternative DLLs that are used in Windows programs.</li>
<li><strong>XBMC</strong> - XBMC Media Center. A cross-platform media player that allows users to play videos, music, podcasts. It has a variety of themes and skins with a large library of plugins.</li>
<li><strong>GNU</strong> - GNU's Not Unix! It is a Unix-like operating system developed by the GNU Project. It is composed of free software only, and is Unix compatible. GNU's design is Unix like, but it is free software and contains no Unix code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My thoughts</h2>

<p>Recursive acronyms are often used for their edginess and their humor, and are a great example of how hacker culture and computer culture works&mdash;we're all here to have fun :)</p>
