<h1>Running jekyll locally for FOSSASIA</h1>

<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> allows one to use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> on their site. Github compiles everything on their own servers and serves them to visitors.</p>

<p>However, for testing and development, it is a wise idea to have Jekyll running on your local environment. This quick guide will run you through getting jekyll running on your computer.</p>

<h2>Why Jekyll</h2>

<p>We've begun to use Jekyll for <a href="http://fossasia.org/">FOSSASIA's</a> <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gci/homepage/google/gci2014">Google Code-in</a> <a href="http://fossasia.github.io/">site</a>. This tutorial was because of a <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gci/task/view/google/gci2014/5870997106327552">task on GCI</a>. </p>

<p>Jekyll is useful for sites hosted on Github because it allows using Coffeescript and SASS. You get to separate out the data from the template by using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/">Jekyll Data Files</a>. You can use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/">Variables</a> and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/">YAML Front Matter</a> for more advance customization. </p>

<p>In our case, we primarily used Jekyll to separate logic from data by using Data Files, and to use SASS for better stylesheets. FOSSASIA's GCI site allows students to add their own information and photos. Previously, students would have to copy-paste a section of HTML code and make changes in the HTML to get themselves to appear on the site. This was difficult for inexperienced students and often led to problems in code, like syntax errors and uneven indenting - all very confusing to maintain. Adding a new student's info almost always resulted in a merge conflict, and all merges had to be done manually.</p>

<p>The new version with jekyll has a <code>students.json</code> file in it's <code>_data</code> directory. The file is an array of objects, one for each student. A student can add information like their social media links, their photo, and their image simply by editing this JSON file. For social media profiles, they simply need to enter their username, not the whole URL - the template handles the rest.</p>

<p>The template code is now separate and is run by nested loops using Liquid. This ensure perfect uniformity and making changes are easier. For example, if we want to change the animation style, it is simply one change instead of changing every occurrence. </p>

<p>Using SCSS allows the site to run SCSS-lint, which ensures that the CSS written is uniform and free of errors. Variables and nesting by SCSS is also useful in the website's design.</p>

<h2>Setting Up</h2>

<p>First, you should have a local copy of the <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/fossasia.github.io">fossasia site</a>. You'll notice a file called 'Gemfile' in the root, this is required for installing and configuring the gem.</p>

<p>You also need <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">Node.JS</a> installed. Windows users can get ruby from <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/">RubyInstaller</a>.</p>

<p>Next, we'll install Bundler. Bundler is the package manager for Ruby, that will make managing installs of Jekyll and other gems very easy. Install Bundler by running <code>gem install bundler</code> in the command line.</p>

<p>Navigate to the fossasia.github.io folder (where the <code>Gemfile</code> is located) on the command line. Run <code>bundle install</code> to install dependencies for the <a href="https://github.com/github/pages-gem"><code>github-pages</code></a> gem. The pages gem installs many dependencies, which include jekyll, jekyll-coffeescript, jekyll-sass-converter - All very useful for an average development project.See the <a href="https://github.com/github/pages-gem#list-dependency-versions">full list here</a>. We don't exactly use many of these dependencies, but it is important to have all to exactly mimic Github. Apart from that, the pages gem isn't really much different from the normal jekyll gem.</p>

<h2>Running!</h2>

<p>Running <code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code> in the repo's directory will compile and run your site <em>exactly</em> how Github would compile and run it. You'll be able to see the site on your computer by visiting <code>localhost:4000</code>. Congrats!</p>
